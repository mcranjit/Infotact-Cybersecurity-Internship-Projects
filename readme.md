# Internship Projects: Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing

This repository contains projects completed during my **3-month internship** as a Security Admin Associate L1. Each project focuses on practical implementations of cybersecurity principles, with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and server hardening.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Basic Vulnerability Assessment for a Small Business Network**

* **Objective**: Identify security gaps in a simulated small business IT infrastructure.
* **Tools Used**: Kali Linux, Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit.
* **Deliverables**:

  * Vulnerability Assessment Report
  * Network and Port Scan Reports
  * Mitigation Strategies

**Status**: Completed ✅

### 2. **Web Application Penetration Testing (OWASP Top 10 Focus)**

* **Objective**: Perform penetration testing on vulnerable web applications like DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop.
* **Key Tests**:

  * SQL Injection
  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  * Security Misconfigurations
* **Tools Used**: Burp Suite, OWASP Juice Shop, Kali Linux.
* **Deliverables**:

### 3. **Secure Linux Server Setup & Hardening**

* **Objective**: Deploy and harden a Linux server to protect against common attack vectors.
* **Key Tasks**:

  * Configure SSH, Firewall (UFW), and Fail2ban.
  * Audit with CIS Benchmarks.
  * Perform vulnerability scans and fine-tune configurations.
* **Deliverables**:

  * Hardened Server Documentation
  * Reusable Security Checklist

**Status**: Ongoing ⏳
